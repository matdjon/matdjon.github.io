    So far, I have been collecting inputs and experiences from several places. The first is a public hospital's engineering/development department. Then, a factory providing electronic manufacturing services (EMS) followed by a water treatment solution provider, specializing in water chlorination system. Lastly, a company which provides human resources (HR) management software known as GoJupiter.
